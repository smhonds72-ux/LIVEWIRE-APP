# Environment Variables for App Builder
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values

# REQUIRED: Grid API Configuration
VITE_GRID_API_KEY=your_grid_api_key_here
# Get your API key from: https://grid.gg/ or your Grid dashboard
# Without this key, live mode will not work and will fall back to mock data

# OPTIONAL: Supabase Configuration (for additional features)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here

# OPTIONAL: Team Configuration (if you want to filter by specific team)
VITE_TEAM_ID=your_team_id_here

# Example team IDs for testing:
# VITE_TEAM_ID=team-123
# VITE_TEAM_ID=fnc-esports
# VITE_TEAM_ID=team-liquid

# IMPORTANT: The app will work in mock mode without these keys
# But live mode requires VITE_GRID_API_KEY to fetch real player data
